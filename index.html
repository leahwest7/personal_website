        In June 2021, I graduated from Dana Hills High School from the Health and Medical Occupations Academy as a valedictorian. 
        I plan to attend Harvey Mudd College (HMC) and major in mathematical and 
        computation biology as a premed student, but that can change as I explore the various STEM 
        majors HMC has to offer.
        When I'm not hitting the books, you can find me playing soccer or football, 
        basking in the sun's rays on the beach, tutoring, or playing guitar. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since middle school, I have developed a love
        of all things STEM, so much so that I delievered a presentation about
        Women in STEM to my peers (see video in portfolio page).
        In terms of career aspirations, I have an affinity for medicine and I am currently leaning towards biomedical engineering
        or pediatrics. I love the medical field because it allows me to combine
        my fascination with science and my desire to help people. 
        However, I am also interested in Computer Science and Art History. I look 
        forward to exploring these different subjects more in college.

      <p>
        In conclusion, welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy exploring my
        code, blogs, and other projects!
