        I graduated from Harvey Mudd College (HMC) with a degree in Computer Science and concentration in Art History.
        I am currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft working on the Azure Compute team.
         I added a crucial component of security for virtual machine users. Previously, I have also interned at
        JPMorgan Chase as a software engineering fellow and conducted computer
        science-education research and published a paper alongside a PhD student at the University of
        Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During my undergraduate education, I worked as a web
        developer for an HMC prof, augmenting his music website and building
        music quizzes for his classes.

        My love for programming began with Girls Who Code and flourished under the supportive Computer Science
        Department at Harvey Mudd College. I was encouraged to combine my liberal arts interests in Art History
        with my programming capabilities. As such, I have conducted eye tracking projects of artworks, coding photoshop
        editing tools from scratch, and exploring AI inpainting applications for art conservation.
      </p>

        In conclusion, welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy exploring my
        code, blogs, and other passion projects!
