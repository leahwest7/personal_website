        I am a rising senior at Dana Hills High School in Dana Point, CA. When
        I'm not hitting the books, you can find me playing soccer or football, 
        laying on the beach, or playing guitar. I am the leader of the
        Journey Club, a Christian club on my school campus, and I am part of the
        HMO, Health and Medical, Program at Dana. This program has given me
        opportunites to intern at various medical offices and learn more about
        different medical professions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since middle school, I have developed a love
        of all things STEM, so much so that I delievered a presentation about
        Women in STEM to my peers (see video in portfolio page).
        In terms of career aspirations, I have an affinity for medicine and I am currently leaning towards sports medicine 
        or pediatrics. I love the medical field because it allows me to combine
        my fascination with science and my desire to help people. 
        However, I am also interested in Political Science and Art History. I look 
        forward to exploring these different subjects more in college.
    
       
      </p>

      <p>
        In conclusion, welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy exploring my
        code, blogs, and other STEM related projects!
